#NBA Team Trackr
Visualizing the relationship between average margin of victory and pace.

###Description
A key statistic (especially when comparing elite teams) is the "Average Margin of Victory". This value helps to
quantify how dominant a team is as they progress through the season. With the recent blow out wins by the Golden State Warriors,
I wanted a better way to easily visualize this data.

I thought it would be useful to build an app that lets users search through all the NBA teams (by name, location, division) and see
if there was any correlation between "Average Margin of Victory" and the "Average Pace" of a team.

###Calculations
Margin = Average Points Scored - Average Points Allowed

Pace: # of Possessions used by a team per 48 mins

###Built with
React.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

###Future
1. Deploy to Heroku
2. Improve website responsiveness
3. Incorporate a Team "show page" that shows relevant statistics and rankings
