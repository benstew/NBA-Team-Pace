#NBA Team Efficiency
Comparison of the "Net Efficiency" by number of possessions

###Description
A key statistic when comparing elite teams, is the average margin of victory. This value helps to
quantify a teams dominance as they progress through the season. With the recent blow out wins by the Golden State Warriors,
I wanted a better way to easily visualize the data.

I thought it would be useful to build an app that lets users search through all the NBA teams (by name, location, division) and see
if there was any correlation between average margin of victory and the average pace of a team.

###Calculations
Margin = Average Points Scored - Average Points Allowed
Pace: # of Possessions used by a team per 48 mins

###Built with
React.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

###Future
1. Deploy to Heroku
2. Improve website responsiveness
3. Incorporate a Team "show page" that shows relevant statistics and rankings
